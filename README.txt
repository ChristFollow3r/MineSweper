I've been working with GitHub just to get used to it. Here's my repo link if you want to check it out: https://github.com/ChristFollow3r/MineSweper.git


About the part of the code where it reveals the cells around a '.' cell, I asked chat.gpt the day before how rhat could be done because I had no idea. Yesterday (Saturday) I was working on Visual Studio and out of nowhere an AI suggested me the whole code I needed to do that. I didn't use it but rather studied it and then I wrote it on my own with Chat.gpt's supervision, since I really didn't get how that thing worked. Now I'm confident I could write it alone; this is just to let you know.

Over all I've been using chat.gpt to check for mistakes on my code, but I wrote the whole thing on my own (except for a couple things (I've let you know in the code)).
